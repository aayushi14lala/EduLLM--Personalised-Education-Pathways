# EduLLM--Personalised-Education-Pathways

EduLLM is powered by Google's Gemini AI (gemini-1.5-flash-latest), utilizing LangChain for conversational memory and document retrieval.
It employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a vector database (ChromaDB) and embeddings from Hugging Face to ensure accurate responses.
The chatbot fetches career-related content from the web via WebBaseLoader, processes it with a context-aware retriever, and provides insightful answers in real-time. \n
